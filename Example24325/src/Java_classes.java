    // Classes, Objects , Visibility MModifiers and Practicals - for classes and Objects
    // Classes and objects provide a way to organise your code into generic , reusable pieces.
    // Methods and Properties can be made private: Programmers don't have to know anything about the class or object, they simply have to know what services the object offers and how to access them.

    // OBJECT: Are basic runtime entities in object-oriented systems; they represent an entity that can be distinctively identified.

    //the state of an object is represented by the data fields with their current values.

    // the Behavior of an Object depends on Methods implemented.

    // CLASS
    // class is a collection if objects of similar type. or It's a template that simply defines what an object data fields and methods should be.
    // once a class is created, any number of objects can be created(instantiated within it)
    // Classes provide special methods and types (Constructors; which are invoked  to create new objects)
    // Java Class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define actions.
